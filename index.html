          <p>
            I am a Software Engineer at <a href="https://twosense.ai" class="strong" target="_blank">Twosense</a>
            where I work on the platform and backend teams, working with everything from low-level Windows driver APIs
            to modern web apps.
          </p>

          <p>
            I previously worked at <a href="https://makerbot.com" class="strong" target="_blank">MakerBot</a>
            where I made projects that integrated their extensive line of 3D printers with web-based products to
            better serve their education and professional customers.

          <h2 class="color-yellow">Experience</h2>

          <p>
            While I am principally a software engineer, I like to break out of my comfort zone and explore
            other interests like hardware, user experience, design, 3D art, and CAD in my free time. I learn best by doing, so
            I usually find a personal project to fuel my interest for a certain subject. You can see what I've
            done across all these disciplines on my
            <a href="https://tjhorner.notion.site/94160fa8a6d545a38020c1826080f402" target="_blank">Notion list of projects</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The skills I've picked up through these personal projects have worked their way back into my professional
            life &mdash; for example, if you visit the <a href="https://www.twosense.ai/" target="_blank">Twosense homepage</a>
            (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220709205707/https://www.twosense.ai/" target="_blank">archive</a>),
            you'll see a rotating DNA strand in the hero section. I used my Blender experience to create
            this asset for our website! I love collaborating with other teams on stuff like this, especially if they
            are close to what users see.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also care deeply about making the things I create pleasant to use, and listening to users. I have
            previously volunteered at Telegram on their US support team, where I answered tens of thousands of
            questions from Telegram users, and interacted closely with the development team to make the product
            better. I apply the experience from this role in my daily work and try to have a deep empathy for users
            and consider their role as I build.
          </p>

          <p>
            A good example of this applied experience is at MakerBot during our Thingiverse redesign. We ran into
            several issues and users took to Twitter to report them. I decided to use my personal Twitter account
            to talk to these users and hear them out. As a result our public presence was phenomenally improved,
            and we were able to fix more issues faster, and &mdash; of course &mdash; users were happier.
